## SETUP
The app consists of a python server which does the computations and a web based interface using a nodejs server.

### Install Python Server:
Due to the use of CLIP, it is recommended to use **python3.7** and **torch 1.7.1+cu110** (available [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)).

With the following command you can set up a conda environment named _prosepaint_ where all the dependencies will be installed.
```bash
conda env create -f server/env-server.yml
```

### Run Python Server:
The following command will launch the uvicorn server.
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=.; python server/server_deploy.py
```

### Install NodeJS Server:
```
cd client
npm install
```
### Run NodeJS Server:
```
cd client
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:8003/ in your web browser.

### Build Docker Container

```
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 763104351884.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
